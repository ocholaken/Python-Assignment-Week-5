# 🐍 Python OOP Assignment  

## 📘 Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class 🏗️  
In this task, I created a **Smartphone class** with attributes and methods.  
- Used a constructor `__init__()` to initialize values.  
- Added a **child class** `SmartPhoneWithCamera` to demonstrate **inheritance**.  
- Showed encapsulation by hiding details in methods.  
- Included examples of creating objects and calling their methods.  

### Example Features:
- Make a call 📞  
- Display phone information ℹ️  
- Take a photo with camera 📸

## 🎭 Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge  
In this challenge, I created a **Vehicle class** and subclasses **Car, Plane, Boat**.  
- Each subclass overrides the `move()` method.  
- Demonstrates **polymorphism**, where the same method name behaves differently depending on the object.  

### Example:
- `Car.move()` → **Driving 🚗**  
- `Plane.move()` → **Flying ✈️**  
- `Boat.move()` → **Sailing 🚤**
